The purpose of the Mobile Engage Testing app is to run semi-automated tests from different location around the globe to ensure it's as fast as we want it to be.

The app itself does little more than trigger a few custom events using the Emarsys SDK.

# Building and deploying

We use [bitrise](https://app.bitrise.io/app/ebc0c4c693995c67) to build and deploy the app. The latest version of the app is always available for download from https://emartech.github.io/me-android-testing-app.
